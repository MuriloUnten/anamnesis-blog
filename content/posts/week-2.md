This week, after taking feedback from the professors on the initial project ideas,
the team expanded and refined the ideas in order to present again,
this time in a more holistic way.

The main complain from the professors is that there was little to none mechanics involved in any of the projects.
For that reason, we worked on ideas to add mechanic complexity to the projects.

## New changes to the projects:

### Automatec Anamnesis System
- Add a motor controlled door to open and close the hole where the patient inserts their arm

### Asset Tracking System
- Add an electronically lockable cabinet to store the items that opens and closes with a motor
- Use a regular Wi-Fi network instead of a mesh LoRa network
- Add RFID badges to control and authorize access to the cabinet
- Add Web interface to allow collaborator to generate asset request

### Smart Store System

Apart from that, we worked on getting this blog up and running.
