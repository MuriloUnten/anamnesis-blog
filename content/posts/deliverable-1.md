# Overview
This week, the team worked on buying all of the components that will be needed for the project.
Apart from that, the week's work was divided in four main fronts:
1. Mechanical design
2. Backend design
3. Pressure monitor reverse engineering
4. Experimenting with Text to Speech (TTS) and Speech to Text (STT) solutions

# Mechanical design
Here is the mechanical design so far

the servomotor controlled doors are going to be constructed using a hinge shown in this video

# Backend design
## Overview

The system's backend was designed following UML principles, and so here are UML several different diagrams
